# Java - Homework 2 - Design Patterns

##Adapter Task
Write a program that will expose the work with java.util.List collections through pop() and push() methods
- Write a class that wraps any given List collection
- Implement two methods:
  - Push – that appends a given object
  - Pop – pulls the last object from the collection

##Iterator Task
- Create an java.util.Iterator  implementation that works in LIFO fashion.
- Define a class that inherits `ArrayList` and returns the LIFO iterator to its clients
- LIFO – Last in First Out where in – means set/add operation and out -means remove operation.
